// Ctrl+F / Cmd+F (kanban.proj #198): focuses the board's search box and
// pre-fills "#" with the caret right after it, so typing digits immediately
// forms the #<id> exact-match term in a couple of keystrokes. Pure chord +
// value-decision logic only, same dual-environment export pattern as
// save-hotkey.js — app.js's keydown listener does the DOM part (focus,
// preventDefault, setting .value/selection).
//
// Decision — an existing query in the box: SELECT it, don't clobber it with
// "#". An empty box getting "#" prefilled is the whole point of the feature
// (erasing it by hand to type something else instead is fine, cheap), but
// silently nuking a query someone already typed on the very chord that's
// supposed to help them search would be hostile. Select-all also mirrors
// what Ctrl+F/Cmd+F already does in every browser's native find bar
// (re-opening it re-selects the prior term), so the muscle memory carries
// over: keep typing to replace it, or arrow off to edit in place.
//
// Decision — suppressed while a modal/popup is open: yes. Every popup shares
// the .modal-backdrop convention (position:fixed, inset:0 — app.css), which
// covers the whole viewport, so the search bar sits fully hidden behind it
// whenever one is open. Unlike card #172's Ctrl+S, whose TARGET is the open
// popup itself, this hotkey's target is a board-level control the popup is
// actively covering — focusing it there would silently steal keystrokes from
// the popup's own fields with nothing on screen to explain why. Same
// "no reachable target, no-op, browser default stands" contract as
// save-hotkey's, just the mirror condition: that one fires only INSIDE a
// popup, this one only fires OUTSIDE one.
